# Online Resume Project

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program's JavaScript Foundations section. In this project I used jQuery to display resume data I pulled from four different JavaScript objects. The basic HTML and CSS was provided, though I added a few customizations.
